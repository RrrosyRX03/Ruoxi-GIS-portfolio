# Ruoxi-GIS-portfolio
this is my portfolio for Advanced GIS course.

# About me
My name is Ruoxi Xie, and I'm a second-year Master of Urban Design student. I completed my undergraduate study in Architecture in Shanghai, China. Here at CMU, I have developed an interest in urban design, interaction design, and data-driven urban analysis. 

I'm currently working as a research assistant on Smart Surface for Climate and Health in SoA. I want to explore how urban data can facilitate the design process through analysis, simulation, and prediction. I'm excited about working with people with multi-disciplinary backgrounds, and taking this GIS course!

# What I hope to learn
In this course, I hope to learn more about various tools and their applications in GIS for producing products and conducting analysis. I'm working as a research assistant on Smart Surface, so I want to learn more about data-engineering, visualization, and prediction model. I would like to gain more insights into geospatial analysis and learn how to deal with challenges and opportunities in GIS that may arise in my future work.
